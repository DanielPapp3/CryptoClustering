# CryptoClustering

This repo contains project files relating to the CryptoClustering challenge assignment. The objective of the challenge was to utilize our knowledge of unsupervised machine learning, Python, and related libraries to train an algorithm on a set of data provided by the instructors and see if recent cryptocurrency markets are influenced by 24-hour and 7-day price changes.

The code used to create the algorithm can be found within the root directory of this repository and is entitled "Crypto_Clustering.ipynb". The original data set can be found in the form of a CSV file entitled "crypto_market_data.csv" in the Resources folder of this repository.
